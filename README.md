# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project I have used HTML, CSS and JS to make grid pattern.

This is how to code proceeds

//1 User Enters the rows and column value and submit values.
//2 Clicking submit button initiates the createGrid function.
//3 Values are assigned to column and rows variables.
//4 Calculation is done to create the total no.of squareGrid
//5 Code is executed to create divs equal to the totalcalculated squares and assign them class of squareDiv.
//6 In the end based on the number of columns entered by user the column gets created using css grid property
